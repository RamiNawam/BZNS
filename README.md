# 1. PRODUCT SUMMARY

## One-liner
An AI copilot that takes someone from "I have a skill and want to start a business" to 
"I am legally operating a business in Québec" — all the steps, all the money, all the 
numbers, in one place, in plain language, in any language.

## The problem
Québec has one of the most fragmented startup environments in Canada. To legally start 
a micro-business, you need to navigate at minimum 6 government entities (REQ, Revenu 
Québec, CRA, City of Montréal, sector regulators, Bill 96 compliance), 80+ funding 
programs, and a tax system that surprises every first-time self-employed person. The 
information exists but is scattered across dozens of websites, mostly in bureaucratic 
French, and assumes you already know what you're looking for.

## Who we're building for

**Yara, 26** — Syrian immigrant, pastry chef, Villeray. Wants to sell baked goods from 
her home kitchen. Has no idea what she needs to do legally, what to charge, or that she's 
eligible for $90K+ in funding. Would need 8+ government websites to piece it together.

**Marcus, 23** — McGill grad, Plateau. Freelance software consulting. Thinks he's "just 
doing side work." Doesn't know about REQ registration, 12.8% QPP double contributions, 
or quarterly tax installments. Will be shocked when he sees his actual take-home rate.

**Fatima, 41** — Single mother, Rosemont. Wants to open a home daycare — one of the most 
regulated micro-businesses in QC. Doesn't know about the STA program that provides income 
support during startup.

## Three required questions

**Who are you building this for, and why do they need it?**
Aspiring micro-entrepreneurs in Quebec who have skills but no guide. Immigrants, first-gen 
students, career changers, single parents — people who can't afford a lawyer and accountant 
just to understand what steps to take. Over 60,000 new businesses register in Quebec 
annually, and most founders navigate this maze alone.

**What could go wrong, and what would you do about it?**
Wrong legal/tax guidance could cost someone money or legal trouble. Every recommendation 
links to the authoritative government source. The tool explicitly states it is not a legal 
or accounting advisor. High-stakes decisions present trade-offs and recommend free 
professional resources (YES Montréal, PME MTL, Info entrepreneurs). Claude is constrained 
to a curated knowledge base — it cannot fabricate requirements. Zod validates every AI 
response before it reaches the user.

**How does this help people rather than make decisions for them?**
The tool presents options with explained trade-offs, not recommendations. "Sole 
proprietorship vs corporation" becomes a comparison of costs, liability, and tax 
implications at the user's specific income level — they decide. Funding shows eligibility 
scores — they choose which to apply for. The financial snapshot shows real numbers — they 
set their own prices. We inform, they decide.

# 2. STACK

## Deployed (what runs in production)

| Layer | Tool | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| Framework | **Next.js 14 (App Router)** | React frontend + API routes in one repo. One `git push` deploys everything to Vercel. No separate backend server. |
| Styling | **TailwindCSS** | Fast to build polished UI. Teal primary color system, consistent spacing, clean cards. Claude Code generates Tailwind extremely well. |
| State | **Zustand (3 stores)** | `useProfileStore`, `useRoadmapStore`, `useChatStore`. Lightweight, no boilerplate, persists to localStorage as backup. |
| Database + Auth + Storage | **Supabase** | Postgres database (profiles, roadmap, funding, chat, docs), magic-link auth (no passwords), file storage (.docx contracts), Row Level Security. Team already has experience with it. |
| AI | **Claude API — Sonnet 4.6** | Called for 4 tasks: profile synthesis, roadmap generation, financial insight generation, contextual assistant. Responses validated with Zod before storage. |
| Validation | **Zod** | Schema validation on every Claude response. Catches malformed output before it hits the database. |
| Translations | **i18next** | Static UI strings only (sidebar labels, buttons, headings) in FR/EN. All AI-generated content is multilingual for free via Claude. |
| Documents | **docx npm package** | Generates real .docx files from templates. Legal clauses hardcoded — Claude only fills personalized fields. |
| Deploy | **Vercel** | `git push origin main` → live in 45 seconds. Environment vars set once in dashboard. API routes deploy as serverless functions automatically. |

## Not deployed (local tooling)

| Tool | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Python** | Knowledge base curation scripts: scraping government sites, structuring JSON files, validating data completeness. Runs on your laptops, outputs committed to repo. |
| **VS Code + Claude Code** | Every teammate's IDE. Claude Code writes 80%+ of the implementation. |

## What's NOT in the stack (and why)

- **No Express / FastAPI** — Next.js API routes handle all server-side logic. No second server to deploy, no CORS, no separate hosting.
- **No React Router** — Next.js App Router handles routing via folder structure.
- **No ORM (Prisma/Drizzle)** — Supabase JS client is enough for simple reads/writes.
- **No Java** — Wrong tool for a 4-day hackathon. TypeScript everywhere.
- **No separate backend deployment** — One repo, one Vercel project, one URL.

## Knowledge Base (the competitive moat)

Flat JSON files in `/data/` directory. Version-controlled, reviewed in PRs, loaded at build 
time. Edited directly by your team — no CMS, no database migrations. Contains curated, 
verified Quebec regulatory data that no existing tool has in this form.

# 3. FEATURES (Complete List)

## CORE FEATURES (non-negotiable — this IS your product)

### Feature 1: Conversational Intake
8 plain-language questions that build a structured user profile. One question per screen, 
progress bar, stored in Supabase. Claude classifies the business type and sector from 
free-text input. This is the single entry point — every other feature reads from this 
profile. Inputs: business idea (free text), location + borough, home-based vs commercial, 
age, immigration status, expected monthly revenue, partners/employees, languages spoken.

### Feature 2: Legal Roadmap
Personalized, dependency-ordered checklist of every legal/administrative step to operate. 
Claude generates it from the curated knowledge base, specific to their business type, 
location, borough, and structure. Each step has: plain-language description, cost, timeline, 
required documents, direct government link, source citation. Users can mark steps complete 
and pick up where they left off. Dependency enforcement: locked steps show which 
prerequisites are missing.

### Feature 3: Funding Matcher
Deterministic scoring engine (no AI) that ranks 15+ Quebec funding programs against the 
user's profile. Each program scored on age, location, citizenship, business stage, sector, 
and demographics. Shows match score (0-100), amount, type (grant/loan/tax credit), 
eligibility breakdown (✅/❌ per criterion), and application link. Claude only called when 
user clicks "explain this program." The "$95,000+ available" total is a key demo moment.

### Feature 4: Financial Snapshot
A single-screen financial reality check that answers: "If I charge X and sell Y, what do I 
actually take home?" Hybrid engine: deterministic math for tax calculations (GST/QST, 
QPP at 12.8%, QPIP, federal + provincial income tax brackets) + Claude for 
situation-specific insights (missing expense categories, pricing guidance, risk flags). 
Mostly powered by data already captured in intake — only 2-3 additional inputs needed 
(monthly expenses, optionally price per unit and volume). Output: gross revenue → taxes → 
contributions → expenses → actual take-home number. Includes "watch out" flags (approaching 
QST threshold, quarterly installments due, expenses you're probably forgetting).

### Feature 5: Contextual AI Assistant
Persistent chat interface that knows the user's full state: profile, roadmap progress, 
funding matches, financial snapshot, and conversation history. Answers questions specific 
to their situation. Cites sources from the knowledge base. Refers to professionals (YES 
Montréal, PME MTL, Éducaloi, community tax clinics) when out of scope. Available from 
every screen.

## STRETCH FEATURES (build if core is solid by end of Day 2)

### Feature 6: Starter Kit
One-click generation of personalized business documents as downloadable .docx files. 
Three document types: bilingual FR/EN service contract (Bill 96 compliant), invoice 
template (with NEQ, GST/QST fields), and 2-paragraph business pitch. Legal clauses are 
hardcoded templates — Claude only fills personalized fields (business name, price, NEQ, 
borough, service description). Upload to Supabase Storage, return signed download URL.

### Feature 7: Pricing Engine
Pure math, no AI. User enters their actual costs (ingredients, packaging, time, utilities). 
Engine calculates true cost per unit, compares against hardcoded Montréal market rates for 
their business type, and recommends a price with visible reasoning. Projects monthly revenue 
and profit at each price tier. LOWEST PRIORITY — cut this first if behind schedule.

## INFRASTRUCTURE (invisible to user, critical to winning)

### Infrastructure 1: Curated Knowledge Base
14+ structured JSON files covering business structures, REQ registration, tax obligations 
(GST/QST, QPP, income tax, deductions), sector permits (MAPAQ, Ministère de la Famille, 
municipal Montreal), 15+ funding programs with eligibility rules, Bill 96 compliance, and 
Quebec financial constants (tax brackets, contribution rates). Every fee verified against 
official government page, every URL tested.

### Infrastructure 2: Response Caching
Pre-generate and cache Yara's roadmap, funding results, financial snapshot, and assistant 
answers in Supabase. Live demo runs from cache if Claude API is slow on hackathon day. 
Judges never see a spinner.

### Infrastructure 3: Trilingual AI Responses
Claude responds in whatever language the user writes in (EN/FR/AR). Static UI strings 
translated for FR/EN via i18next. No extra work for Arabic in the AI layer — it's native 
to Claude.

### Infrastructure 4: Pre-loaded Demo Account
Yara's profile fully populated, roadmap generated, funding scored, financial snapshot 
calculated, chat history seeded. Log in and everything is already there. Zero friction 
in the 5-minute pitch.

# 7. API ROUTES SPECIFICATION

## Route 1: `POST /api/profile`

Takes raw intake answers → Claude synthesizes structured profile → stored in Supabase.

Input: `{ user_id, answers: { business_idea, location, borough, is_home_based, age, immigration_status, expected_monthly_revenue, has_partners, languages, preferred_language } }`

Server-side: Validate with Zod → Call Claude (profile synthesis prompt) → Validate response → Upsert profiles table → Return profile.

Claude's job: Classify business_type, infer industry_sector, suggest business_name, write business_description. NOT: give advice.

Output: Complete profile object with all fields.

## Route 2: `POST /api/roadmap`

Generates personalized, dependency-ordered legal roadmap.

Input: `{ profile_id }`

Server-side: Fetch profile → Check cache → Select relevant KB files via selector.ts → Call Claude (roadmap prompt + KB + profile) → Validate with Zod → Batch insert roadmap_steps → Cache → Return.

Output: `{ steps: [{ step_order, step_key, title, description, why_needed, estimated_cost, estimated_timeline, required_documents, government_url, source, depends_on }] }`

## Route 3: `POST /api/funding`

Deterministic scoring + optional Claude explanation.

Input: `{ profile_id, explain_program?: string }`

Server-side (scoring — no AI): Fetch profile → Load funding JSONs → Run scorer.ts → Filter score > 0 → Sort by score → Batch insert funding_matches → Return.

Server-side (explain — Claude): Find program JSON → Call Claude with profile + program → Return explanation.

Output: `{ matches: [{ program_key, program_name, type, amount, match_score, eligibility_details, application_url }], total_potential_funding }`

## Route 4: `POST /api/financial-snapshot` ← NEW

Hybrid: deterministic tax math + Claude for situation-specific insights.

Input: `{ profile_id, monthly_expenses?: number, expense_categories?: object, price_per_unit?: number, units_per_month?: number }`

Server-side:
1. Fetch profile (has expected_monthly_revenue, business_structure, business_type)
2. Update profile with any new financial inputs
3. Load `financial_constants.json`
4. Run `tax-calculator.ts`:
   - annual_revenue = monthly_revenue × 12
   - If annual_revenue > 30000: calculate GST/QST collected and remittable
   - net_revenue = annual_revenue - (monthly_expenses × 12)
   - federal_tax = calculateBrackets(net_revenue, federal_brackets, federal_personal_amount)
   - provincial_tax = calculateBrackets(net_revenue, quebec_brackets, quebec_personal_amount)
   - qpp = min(net_revenue - 3500, 71300 - 3500) × 0.128
   - qpip = min(net_revenue, 98000) × 0.00878
   - total_deductions = federal_tax + provincial_tax + qpp + qpip
   - annual_take_home = net_revenue - total_deductions
   - monthly_take_home = annual_take_home / 12
   - effective_rate = monthly_take_home / monthly_revenue
5. Call Claude (financial insight prompt):
   - "Given this user's business type and expenses, suggest 3-5 expense categories 
     they might be forgetting. Estimate a reasonable price range for their product/service. 
     Flag any financial risks or opportunities."
6. Validate Claude response with Zod
7. Upsert into financial_snapshots table
8. Cache the response
9. Return full snapshot

# 8. SYSTEM PROMPTS

## Prompt 1: Profile Synthesis
```
SYSTEM:
You are a business classification engine for a Quebec micro-business startup tool.
Your ONLY job is to take a user's intake answers and produce a structured business profile.

Rules:
- Classify into exactly ONE type: food, freelance, daycare, retail, personal_care, other
- Infer the industry_sector (e.g., "bakery", "software_consulting", "home_daycare")
- If no business name provided, suggest one based on their description
- Write a one-sentence business_description that is specific and factual
- Do NOT give legal advice, recommendations, or next steps
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON — no preamble, no markdown

Schema:
{
  "business_type": "food" | "freelance" | "daycare" | "retail" | "personal_care" | "other",
  "industry_sector": string,
  "business_name": string | null,
  "business_description": string
}

USER:
Here are the intake answers:
{{INTAKE_ANSWERS_JSON}}
```

## Prompt 2: Roadmap Generation
```
SYSTEM:
You are a regulatory guide for starting a micro-business in Quebec. Generate a 
personalized, ORDERED checklist of legal and administrative steps for this specific person.

Your knowledge base (ONLY source of truth — do not add anything not in this data):
{{SELECTED_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_JSON}}

Rules:
1. SEQUENCE by dependency. Can't get MAPAQ permit before NEQ. Can't register QST before business number.
2. PERSONALIZE every step. Not "register your business" — "Register 'Amina's Kitchen' as a sole proprietorship with the REQ in Villeray."
3. INCLUDE ONLY RELEVANT STEPS. Freelancer doesn't need MAPAQ. Bakery doesn't need professional order.
4. Each step must have: step_order, step_key, title, description, why_needed, estimated_cost, estimated_timeline, required_documents, government_url, source, depends_on.
5. NEVER invent fees, URLs, or requirements not in the knowledge base.
6. NEVER give legal advice. Present facts.
7. Aim for 5-12 steps.
8. Respond ONLY with valid JSON: { "steps": [...] }

USER:
Generate a legal roadmap for:
{{PROFILE_JSON}}
```

## Prompt 3: Financial Insights ← NEW
```
SYSTEM:
You are a financial awareness tool for new micro-business owners in Quebec. Given a user's 
business profile and their financial numbers, provide practical insights. You are NOT a 
financial advisor — you help people understand their numbers.

The user's tax calculations have already been done by a deterministic engine. Your job is 
to provide three things:

1. SUGGESTED EXPENSES: Based on their business type and setup, suggest 3-5 expense 
   categories they might be forgetting to account for. Be specific to their business 
   (a home baker has different expenses than a freelance coder). Include estimated 
   monthly amounts for Montreal.

2. PRICING INSIGHT: Based on their business type, location, and costs, provide 1-2 
   sentences about typical pricing in their market. Reference their cost per unit if 
   available. Never tell them what to charge — inform them about the range.

3. WATCH OUT FLAGS: 1-3 financial risks or opportunities specific to their situation. 
   Examples: approaching QST threshold, QPP double contribution surprise, deductible 
   expenses they should track, quarterly installment requirements.

Rules:
- Be specific to their business type and location, not generic
- Never say "you should" — say "you could" or "many [business type] owners..."
- Keep each item to 1-2 sentences
- Respond in their preferred language
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON matching the schema

USER:
Business profile: {{PROFILE_JSON}}
Calculated numbers: {{TAX_CALCULATIONS_JSON}}
```

## Prompt 4: Contextual Assistant
```
SYSTEM:
You are a helpful assistant in a Quebec micro-business startup tool.

Who you are talking to: {{PROFILE_JSON}}
Their roadmap progress: {{ROADMAP_STEPS_WITH_STATUS_JSON}}
Their funding matches: {{FUNDING_MATCHES_JSON}}
Their financial snapshot: {{FINANCIAL_SNAPSHOT_JSON}}
Knowledge base: {{SELECTED_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_JSON}}
Previous conversation: {{LAST_10_MESSAGES_JSON}}

Rules:
1. Answer based on THEIR SPECIFIC SITUATION with real numbers from their profile.
2. ALWAYS CITE your source from the knowledge base.
3. STAY IN YOUR LANE. Refer to professionals when out of scope:
   - Free business advice: YES Montréal, Info entrepreneurs (1-888-576-4444)
   - Free legal info: Éducaloi (educaloi.qc.ca)
   - Accounting: suggest a CPA or community tax clinic
   - PME MTL advisors: pmemtl.com
4. USE THEIR LANGUAGE. Match the language they write in.
5. BE CONCISE. 2-4 sentences per answer.
6. NEVER FABRICATE. If not in the KB, say so and give a referral.
7. Respond as JSON: { "message": "...", "sources": [...], "suggested_actions": [...] }
```

## Knowledge Base Selector (TypeScript, not a prompt)
```typescript
const KB_MAP: Record<BusinessType, string[]> = {
  food: ['req.json', 'revenu_quebec.json', 'mapaq.json', 'municipal_montreal.json', 'gst_qst.json', 'qpp.json', 'deductions.json', 'bill96.json', 'business_structures.json', 'financial_constants.json'],

# 10. FEATURE LOGIC — IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

## Feature 1: Intake
State machine: IDLE → Q1 → Q2 → ... → Q8 → SUBMITTING → COMPLETE.
One question per screen. Answers mapped to raw profile. POST /api/profile on submit.
Claude classifies business_type + industry_sector. Redirect to dashboard on success.

## Feature 2: Legal Roadmap
Fetch profile → check cache → select KB slice → call Claude → validate Zod → store steps 
→ render. Step completion tracked in Supabase. Dependency enforcement via depends_on 
field. Lock icon on blocked steps.

Expected output per persona:
- Yara (bakery): 9 steps (structure → NEQ → zoning → MAPAQ cert → MAPAQ permit → occupancy → GST/QST → bank → Bill 96)
- Marcus (freelance): 8 steps (registration check → NEQ → tax setup → GST/QST → QPP → deductions → bank → Bill 96)
- Fatima (daycare): 10 steps (structure → NEQ → Ministère contact → training → background check → premises → permit → occupancy → GST/QST → STA)

## Feature 3: Funding Matcher
Deterministic scorer: for each program, evaluate eligibility rules against profile. 
Hard requirements (age, citizenship) → score 0 if failed. Soft requirements → reduces 
score. Sort by score descending. Claude only for "explain" button.

Expected output:
- Yara (26, PR, food): Futurpreneur 94, PME MTL Young 88, STA 71 → ~$95K
- Marcus (23, citizen, freelance): Futurpreneur 92, PME MTL 85, BDC 70 → ~$90K
- Fatima (41, citizen, daycare): PME MTL 82, STA 88, BDC 75 → ~$45K (no Futurpreneur, age>39)

### Key UX for Financial Snapshot

**Expense input form** (2-3 fields, minimal friction):
- "Estimated monthly business expenses" — one number input, with helper text: 
  "Include supplies, tools, subscriptions, transport. Don't worry about being exact — 
  we'll suggest things you might be missing."
- Optional: "What do you charge per product/service?" + "How many per month?"
- "Calculate My Take-Home" button

**The take-home reveal** — this is a demo moment:
- Big number, teal color: **$573/mo**
- Below it: "That's a 57.3% take-home rate"
- Visual breakdown bar: Revenue | Expenses | Taxes | QPP | QPIP | Take-Home
- Each segment is colored and labeled with the dollar amount

**Suggested expenses** (from Claude):
- Listed as a checklist with estimated amounts
- "Add to my expenses" button next to each → recalculates instantly
- This is where Claude adds value without hardcoding per industry

**Watch out flags** (from Claude):
- Colored badges: blue (info), amber (warning), green (tip)
- Expandable for detail

## Feature 5: AI Assistant
Context includes ALL user data: profile + roadmap + funding + financial snapshot + 
last 10 messages + KB. Token budget ~8,000-10,000 tokens input, well within limits.
Pre-loaded questions adapt to user state.

## Feature 6: Starter Kit (stretch)
Template-based .docx generation. Hardcoded legal clauses. Claude fills personalized 
fields. Upload to Supabase Storage, return signed URL.

## Feature 7: Pricing Engine (lowest priority)
Pure math calculator. Cut this first if behind schedule.

## DAY 4 — Saturday April 4 (Hackathon Day)

| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| 10:00 | Check-in at Trottier. Set up, connect WiFi, verify deployment. |
| 10:30 | Opening ceremony. Listen for Brim Financial sub-challenge. |
| 11:00-12:30 | Final polish. If Brim aligns → Person C spends max 2hr on integration. Otherwise: stabilize. |
| 12:30 | Lunch |
| 1:00-3:00 | Final testing + rehearsal × 2 on presentation laptop |
| 3:00-4:00 | Buffer. Fix nothing unless critical. |
| 4:00 | **SUBMISSION DEADLINE** |
| 4:15 | Demo presentations (5 min + 2 min Q&A) |
| 5:45 | Awards |

## Prepared Q&A

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "What if the knowledge base is outdated?" | Every entry is date-stamped and links to the official source. Users can always verify. The architecture supports updates by editing JSON files — no code changes needed. |
| "How do you prevent Claude from hallucinating?" | Three layers: Claude is constrained to our curated KB (can't invent requirements), Zod validates every response against a strict schema before storage, and all tax math is deterministic TypeScript — not AI. |
| "Are the financial calculations accurate?" | The tax calculator uses official 2026 rates from CRA and Revenu Québec. We clearly state this is an estimate, not professional tax advice, and recommend consulting a CPA for their specific situation. |
| "Could this scale beyond Quebec?" | The architecture is modular — the KB is swappable. Same pipeline works for Ontario, BC, or any jurisdiction. The tax calculator loads constants from a JSON file per jurisdiction. |
| "What's the business model?" | Free for individuals. Premium tier for accountants, business advisors, and government agencies who want to embed this in their services. |

## Emergency Protocols

- **Claude API down:** Serve from response_cache. Demo works without live API.
- **Vercel down:** Run locally: `npm run dev`. Present from localhost.
- **Feature broken during demo:** Skip it. "We also built X, let me show you Y."
- **Over time:** Cut architecture slide. Demo speaks louder.
- **Judge asks about unbuilt feature:** "That's on our roadmap. Here's how we'd implement it."
